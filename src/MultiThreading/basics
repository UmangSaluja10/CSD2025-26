QUES 1. Diff between multiProgramming, multiProcessing, multiTasking and multiThreading
ANS 1. multiProgramming: multiple jobs are loaded in the CPU one by one if any program wait for resource.
multiProcessing: multiple cores of CPU running tasks concurrently.
multiTasking: multiple programs running processes so fast in slices it create  illusion of parallalism.
multiThreading: process are divided into multiple threads

there are 2 ways to create threads in java:
1) thread class
2) runnable interface (with a method run())


1) Thread classs:
class CSD extends Thread{
public void run(){
    System.out.println("task");
}
public static void main(String[] args){
    CSD cs = new CSD();
    cs.start();
}
}

2) Runnable interface:
class runnableClass implements Runnalbe{
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("tak");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        runnableClass cs = new runnableClass();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(cs);
        t1.start();
    }
}
